Welcome to Zulip documentation!
===============================

Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. Written in
Python and using the Django framework, Zulip supports both private
messaging and group chats via conversation streams.

Zulip also supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image
previews, group private messages, audible notifications, missed-message
emails, desktop apps, and much more.

Further information on the Zulip project and its features can be found
at `https://www.zulip.org <https://www.zulip.org>`__ and in these
docs.  Our code is available at `our GitHub repository
<https://github.com/zulip/>`__.
